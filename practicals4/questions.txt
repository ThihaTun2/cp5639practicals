   value.
4. It is not following the python naming convention of lowercases variables with underscores between each words.
5. Augmented Assignment Operators are a combination of 2 assignments operators to make the arithematic calculations
   between the objects more clear. For example "i += 1" is equal to "i = i + 1".

Logic Exercise


Only ONE pull of marbles is needed.
The label is swapped around meaning that the label is wrong.
By pulling from the box that is labeled to have one black and one white marble, we can determine the contents of all
three boxes. If the marble is white we can assume the other marble is while and if the marble is black we can assume the
other marble is black.
And if the box that is labelled black+white first marble is white and contains two white marbles, that the box that is
labelled to contain two black marbles has to contain one black and one white marbles, as it cannot contains two black
marbles since the labels are wrong and cannot contain two white marbles since the box that is labelled black and white
 contains two white marbles.
The opposite is true if the box that is labelled black+white first marble is black.
